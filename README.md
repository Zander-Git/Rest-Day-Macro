# Rest-Day-Macro

This macro in Excel was made to help a friend work through a time sheet of employees and see how many people are on leave on each day.
The hard part is that adjencent cells can influence a cells state without it being displayed.
With this project being sucessful, it will remove human error and drastically reduce time to complete the task.

To use, paste the table you get into the light blue cell. To begin with you will need to move the counting functions around a bit to line up properly.
From there, click the button and it should all work accordingly.


This program assumes that
    1) there are no empty cells in the grid
    2) there exist no cells with underscores already in.
