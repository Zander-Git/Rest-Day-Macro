# Rest-Day-Macro

This macro in Excel was made to help a friend work through a time sheet of employees and see how many people are on leave on each day.
The hard part is that adjencent cells can influence a cells state without it being displayed.
With this project being sucessful, it will remove human error and drastically reduce time to complete the task.
